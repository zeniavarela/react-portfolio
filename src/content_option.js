  aboutme:
    " I come from a background in military intelligence where I honed skills in problem-solving, attention to detail, and collaboration. My work helped safeguard national security and contributed to the success of various military missions.  My transition into web development stems from a deep-seated curiosity about creating solutions and making a meaningful impact especially in the context of secure systems and the role technology plays in defending against cyber threats. In the military, I learned the importance of adaptability and quick thinking, skills I've translated into coding. As I navigate my transition, my WHY is clearâ€”I want to leverage my skills to build innovative and secure user-friendly applications that contribute positively to people's lives.",
